		<p id="about">Panoptikos is an image viewer for Reddit.</p>
		<p id="about-hint">This is an experimental version. Once all problems are fixed and the most requested features are added, it will replace the current Panoptikos. Make sure to tell me what you like or miss, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/Panoptikos">@Panoptikos</a> on Twitter.</p>

		<!-- <h2>What’s different?</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>You can select any subreddits you want (right now only by manipulating the URL in your browser address bar).</li>
			<li>You can save the URL to save your selection of subreddits.</li>
			<li>You see content from Reddit's ”Hot” section (where NSFL troll posts are usually not present).</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Known Issues</h2>
		<ul id="issues">
			<li>Images are often original size even when they are shown as small previews. This means you need a fast Internet connection, it uses a lot of bandwidth, and your browser may crash if all memory is used up.</li>
			<li>Scrolling is jerky.</li>
			<li>The page has a fixed width is hard to view on small screens and wastes space on large screens.</li>
			<li>Images are displayed in rows which causes lots of whitespace in between.</li>
			<li>There are no links to Reddit comments.</li>
			<li>Images open in the same tab as the page.</li>
			<li>There is no endless scrolling, you must click "Load more" all the time.</li>
			<li>There is no convenient way to select subreddits.</li>
			<li>You can't switch between Reddit's "Hot", "New", "Controversial", "Top" sections. (Current default is "Hot".)</li>
		</ul> -->
