// DO NOT EDIT. The values below are updated programmatically by assetcompiler.
// Reason: We compile our CSS and JS files into one CSS and one JS file. This is
// done with Closure Stylesheets and Closure Library which depend on Java. Since
// Java is not available to App Engine Go programs, assetcompiler is executed
// manually before Panoptikos is deployed to App Engine, writing the CSS and JS
// file into the webroot directory and updating the filenames in this very file.
